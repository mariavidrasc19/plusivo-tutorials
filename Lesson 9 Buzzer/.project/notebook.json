There are two types of buzzers, active and passive. In our project, we use\na passive one. A passive buzzer can make different tones, but it requires a PWM\nsignal from the device which controls the buzzer, in order to produce a noise.\n\n#TODO img pg 72\n\nMake sure that you respect the polarity of the component. Usually, there is a\n**plus sign** on top of the buzzer that shows which pin is the positive one.\n\n### Transistor\n\n#TODO img pg 73\n\nA transistor is a device that regulates current or voltage flow and acts as a\nswitch or gate for electronic signals. Transistors are composed of semiconductor\nmaterial, with three layers. The transistor's three-layer structure contains an N-type\nsemiconductor layer sandwiched between P-type layers (a PNP configuration) or a Ptype\nlayer between N-type layers (an NPN configuration). The most common\ntransistor configuration used is the NPN Transistor. You can find below a basic\nscheme for both types:\n\n#TODO img pg 73\n\nThe three pins are: Base (B), Collector (C) and Emitter (E). In a standard NPN\ntransistor, you need to apply a voltage of about 0.7V between the base and the emitter\nto get the current flowing from base to emitter. When you apply 0.7V from base to\nemitter you will turn the transistor ON and allow a current to flow from collector to\nemitter.\n\n## Diode\n\nA diode is an electrical device allowing current to move in one direction. The\nmost common kind of diode in modern circuit design is the semiconductor diode.\nDiodes can be used as rectifiers, signal limiters, voltage regulators, switches, signal \nmodulators, oscillators etc. Below, you can find the schematic symbol and the real\ncomponent appearance.\n\n#TODO img pg 73\n\n## 9.4 Connections\nBelow you can find the schematic:\n\n#TODO img pg 73\n\nAlso, you can find below a visual representation of the project:\n\n#TODO img pg 74","code":"","error":"","result":""},{"id":"8b8ce787-e06a-4596-b52a-cefd72371b1b","type":"markdown","editable":false,"data":"## 9.5 Code\nThe concept of the code is similar to the one used to turn on/off an LED, but\nthis time we will change the code to turn on/off a buzzer.\n\nThe code starts with the import of libraries after it continue with the declaration of the pin used by the buzzer.
